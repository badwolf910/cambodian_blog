        <li>Alwas take your shoes off outside before entering a home, guesthouse, hotel or Wat.</li>
        <li>If exchanging anything with a local, like money or goods, use both hands while exchanging the item.</li>
        <li>Women cannot touch monks.</li>
        <li>If you want to take a picture of a monk, you must ask for permission first.</li>
        <li>Remove hats when entering a home.</li>
        <li>If a host offers you a drink, accept it with both hands and at least take a sip.</li>
        <li>Dress modestly.</li>
        <li>Treat the Khmer people with kindness. Remember, they have lived through some truly horrible times in recent history yet are among some of the kindest people in the world.</li>
